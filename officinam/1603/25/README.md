  - > _"The Canon of Medicine (Arabic: القانون في الطب al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb; Persian: قانون در طب, Qanun-e dâr Tâb) is an encyclopedia of medicine in five books compiled by Persian physician-philosopher Avicenna (ابن سینا, Ibn Sina) and completed in **1025**.[1] Perhaps one of the most famous and influential early books, that continued to influence later creations.[2] It presents an overview of the contemporary medical knowledge of the Islamic world, which had been influenced by earlier traditions including Greco-Roman medicine (particularly Galen),[3] Persian medicine, Chinese medicine and Indian medicine. (...) **The Canon of Medicine remained a medical authority for centuries. It set the standards for medicine in Medieval Europe and the Islamic world and was used as a standard medical textbook through the 18th century in Europe**.[4][5] It is an important text in Unani medicine, a form of traditional medicine practiced in India.[6]"_ - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canon_of_Medicine
