## Simplified explanation of operational stages 0, 1 and 2 for LSF

### From dictionary user perspective


#### Stage 0

LSF stage 0 can be explained as automated strategies to ensure correctness of releases from stage 1 and potentially simplistic checks for stage 2. 
At minimum, it can be as simple generic file format validations.
However, as the dictionaries themselves are able do document other dictionaries,
next automations of stage 0 can be based on previous releases.


#### Stage 1

As the goal of stage 1 operation mode is preparation for stage 2.

> TODO improve this part.

#### Stage 2

Stage 2 targets the actual end users of dictionaries not only in the natural language they prefer, but in a meaningful way they are useful under the jurisdiction (the "country/territory you live") or as existing areas of knowledge exchange (such as data about diseases between different regions) they would be used.

While the traditional dictionaries may be multilingual, not only we're already working with 100's of languages, but the way LSF dictionaries can be encoded allow for something called **semantic reasoning**. As the way Stage 1 allows for advanced localization and the dictionaries often would document concepts used for sensitive, personal data, the humans doing LSF work for Stage 2 would feel the need to fulfill needs that wouldn't have consensus at international level. 

Please note that LSF work targeting "international use" or "neutral" would be considered stage 2: even publications without an overly bureaucratic process done by IGOs tend to explicitly make disclaimer that they do not necessarily reflect the view of the nations which endorse the IGO.


<!--
Stage 0 must be fast, and designed to try fail in ways that allow previous version in use, yet it must allow for valid reasons for inconsistencies.
The main limitation of Stage 0 is that it cannot require human-in-the-loop unless under exceptional circumstances where a global schema change is necessary.

Stage 0 can be based on previous versions of LSF released work.
However, it cannot require _human-in-the-loop_:
not only this would delay releases,
but humans cannot have the dexterity to deal with the level of details OR the error revision would require wait feedback from other humans which may not be available.

### Analogy to computer science bootstrapping

#### Stage 0

#### Stage 1

- **Function (ontological sense: reason to exist)**:
  - Minimal functionality for Stage 2
  - Provide interlingual, language-neutral, taxonomy using controlled identifiers regardless of controlled vocabularies by external authority control.
- **Capabilities (ontological sense: may able to do, but optional)**:
  - Use external controlled vocabularies to document own taxonomy.
  - Provide linguitic terminology to document own taxonomy.

#### Stage 2
> @TODO draft this part

### Analogy to ethical points of view

#### Stage 0

> @TODO draft this part

#### Stage 1

LSF stage 1 lexicography applies **deontological ethics** (...).

#### Stage 2

LSF stage 2 lexicography is free to apply other moral philosophies than the rigid deontological ethics, such as utilitarianism or consequentialism which can forbiden deontological justifications under certain circustances far more common in the real world.
