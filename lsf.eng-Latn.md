## Simplified explanation of operational stages 0, 1 and 2 for LSF

### From end-user perspective

#### Stage 0

From end-user perspective, LSF stage 0 means mostly automated strategies to ensure correctness of releases from stage 1 and potentially stage 2.

Stage 0 can be based on previous versions of LSF released work.
However, it cannot require _human-in-the-loop_:
not only this would delay releases,
but humans cannot have the dexterity to deal with the level of details OR the error revision would require wait feedback from other humans which may not be available.

#### Stage 1

- Function (ontological sense: reason to exist):
  - Minimal functionality for Stage 2
  - Provide interlingual, language-neutral, taxonomy using controlled identifiers regardless of controlled vocabularies by external authority control.
- Capabilities (ontological sense: may able to do, but optional):
  - Use external controlled vocabularies to document own taxonomy.
  - Provide linguitic terminology to document own taxonomy.
